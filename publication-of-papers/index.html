        <h1 class="break-bottom">Publication of papers:<br/> Face Forward International<br/>Typography Conference 2015</h1>

        <p>Thank you very much for your contributions to Face Forward. The feedback has been very positive and we are now following up on our intention to publish a selection of the papers developed for publication. This will be the inaugural issue of a peer-reviewed journal that captures the informed, rigorous and critical debate on typographic research and practice that characterised the papers presented during the conference.</p>

        <p>Our aim is to publish papers that consider typography in as broad a sense as possible, celebrate the vitality and range of typography and strive to expand definitions of both typographic object and practice. Ultimately, the journal hopes to contribute to developing those theoretical and methodological positions around which the disciplines of graphic design and typography could cohere.</p>
		
		<p>Thus we welcome papers that address typography in all its forms, material and immaterial and encourage submissions that make explicit existing connections between craft, research, theory, history, criticism and pedagogy. All those who presented at the conference are invited to submit their papers for consideration.</p>


            <ul class="break-top break-bottom">
